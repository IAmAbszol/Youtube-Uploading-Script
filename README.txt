Dependencies
------------
https://github.com/tokland/youtube-upload

Requirements
------------
Windows: Console Emulator (x64).exe

Format
------
Bash Script

Instructions
------------
Download & Install youtube-uploading script into a directory 
that has no spaces inside the name.

Example: C:\Program Files\youtube-upload 	[X]
	 C:\Users\Bob\youtube-upload		[:)]

As you can see, the first attempt would result in an error 
when calling it through python/the command line.

Running
-------
Copy rename.bash into the directory you are operating on.
Launch using 'bash rename.bash .'
Run 'bash YoutubeUploader.bash DIRECTORY PLAYLIST_NAME'

Then it should be all set, just it will sleep for 3 minutes. 
You may change this, it just helps keep order on youtube.

The script is primarily used to upload videos in bulk, feel free
to change the source code depending on what you require.

Examples of other functionalities are given on tokland's project page
and you may change the description.

Known Bugs
----------
Playlist feature isn't properly created, looking into this further.
